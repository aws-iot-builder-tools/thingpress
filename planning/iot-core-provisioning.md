# AWS IoT Core Device Credential Provisioning Mechanisms

AWS IoT Core offers several mechanisms for provisioning device credentials, each suited for different security requirements, manufacturing processes, and deployment scales. Here's a summary of the available options:

## 1. X.509 Certificate-Based Authentication

### a. Single-Device Provisioning
- **Manual Certificate Creation**: Create and register individual certificates through the AWS IoT console or CLI
- **Just-in-Time Registration (JITR)**: Devices present certificates signed by a registered CA, and AWS IoT automatically registers them
- **Just-in-Time Provisioning (JITP)**: Extension of JITR that also applies provisioning templates to newly registered devices

### b. Bulk Provisioning
- **Multi-Account Registration**: Register certificates across multiple AWS accounts
- **Bulk Registration**: Register multiple certificates in a single API call
- **Fleet Provisioning by Claim**: Devices use a provisioning claim certificate to request unique certificates

## 2. AWS IoT Core Provisioning Services

### a. Fleet Provisioning
- **Fleet Provisioning by Trusted User**: A trusted user provisions devices using temporary credentials
- **Fleet Provisioning by Claim**: Devices use a claim certificate to obtain unique credentials
- **Provisioning Templates**: Define how devices are registered and what resources are created

### b. Secure Tunneling
- Provides secure access to devices behind firewalls using temporary credentials

## 3. Pre-Provisioned Hardware

### a. Secure Element Integration
- **Hardware Security Modules (HSM)**: Physical devices that securely store certificates
- **Trusted Platform Modules (TPM)**: Specialized chips that provide hardware-based security functions
- **Thingpress**: AWS tool for importing pre-provisioned certificates from secure elements (supports Espressif, Infineon, and Microchip)

## 4. Alternative Authentication Methods

### a. Custom Authentication
- **Custom Authorizers**: Lambda functions that authenticate devices using custom authentication schemes
- **Amazon Cognito Integration**: Use Cognito identity pools for device authentication

### b. SigV4 Signing
- Use AWS Signature Version 4 signing process with IAM credentials

## 5. Zero-Touch Provisioning Solutions

### a. AWS IoT Core Device Advisor
- Test and validate device provisioning processes before deployment

### b. AWS IoT ExpressLink
- Pre-integrated hardware modules with built-in provisioning capabilities

## 6. Device Provisioning Service Integrations

- **AWS IoT Greengrass**: Provision core devices and connected devices
- **AWS IoT Device Management**: Manage device provisioning at scale with fleet indexing and dynamic thing groups

Each provisioning mechanism offers different trade-offs between security, ease of implementation, and scalability. The choice depends on your specific manufacturing process, security requirements, and deployment model.
