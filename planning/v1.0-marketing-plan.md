- [ ] Meet linting threshold (9.5+)
- [ ] Security scan clean (no hardcoded credentials)
- [ ] All unit tests passing

### Operational Readiness (Release Blockers)
- [ ] **End-to-end testing automation** for all 4 vendors
- [ ] **Vendor-specific installation validation:**
  - [ ] Espressif SAM deployment and configuration
  - [ ] Infineon bundle processing setup
  - [ ] Microchip JWS token handling
  - [ ] Generated certificate import workflow
- [ ] Error handling and logging across all vendors
- [ ] Performance under load validation
- [ ] AWS service integration testing

## Release Readiness Checklist

### Core Functionality (Release Blockers)
- [ ] All 4 vendor providers working reliably
- [ ] Batch processing with throttling
- [ ] AWS IoT Thing/Policy/Group integration
- [ ] Error handling and recovery
- [ ] Consistent S3 upload experience across vendors

### User Experience (Release Blockers)
- [ ] **Clear installation instructions** for each vendor
- [ ] **Working configuration examples** for each vendor setup
- [ ] **Manifest acquisition guidance** for each vendor
- [ ] Comprehensive error messages
- [ ] Performance expectations documented

### Vendor-Specific Requirements (Release Blockers)

#### Espressif
- [ ] ESP32-S3 manifest processing validated
- [ ] SAM deployment parameters documented
- [ ] Espressif manifest acquisition process documented

#### Infineon  
- [ ] All certificate bundle types (E0E0, E0E1, E0E2) supported
- [ ] Optiga Trust M Express integration validated
- [ ] Bundle acquisition process from Infineon documented

#### Microchip
- [ ] JWS token processing working reliably

- [ ] Certificate format requirements specified
- [ ] Integration examples with certificate generation tools

## Demo Strategy

### Single Universal Demo (Release Blocker)
**"Drag-and-Drop Certificate Import"**
- Shows consistent user experience across all vendors
- Demonstrates S3 upload → processing → AWS IoT registration flow
- Highlights scalability and performance
- Can use any vendor's manifest as example

### Vendor-Specific Content (Release Blockers)
**Installation and Configuration Guides**
- Focus on setup differences, not user experience differences
- Document manifest acquisition from each vendor
- Provide working configuration examples
- Include troubleshooting for vendor-specific issues

## Success Metrics for v1.0 Launch
- [ ] All 4 vendors can be successfully installed and configured
- [ ] End-to-end workflow works reliably for each vendor
- [ ] Documentation enables successful first-time setup
- [ ] Performance meets stated benchmarks (100K+ certs/hour)
- [ ] Security standards maintained across all integrations

## Post-v1.0.0 Immediate Roadmap

### v1.0.1 - Multi-Attachment Enhancement (Next Step)
**Multiple Policy, Thing Type, and Thing Group Support**
- Enable attachment to multiple Thing Groups (e.g., department + location + product)
- Support multiple policies for layered access control
- Allow multiple Thing Types for complex device categorization
- Maintain backward compatibility with single attachments
- **Use Case:** Enterprise IoT deployments with complex organizational hierarchies
- **Priority:** High - addresses fundamental configuration limitation for enterprise users
