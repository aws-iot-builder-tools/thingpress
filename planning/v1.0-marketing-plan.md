## Demo Strategy

### Single Universal Demo (Release Blocker)
**"Drag-and-Drop Certificate Import"**
- Shows consistent user experience across all vendors
- Demonstrates S3 upload → processing → AWS IoT registration flow
- Highlights scalability and performance
- Can use any vendor's manifest as example

### Vendor-Specific Content (Release Blockers)
**Installation and Configuration Guides**
- Focus on setup differences, not user experience differences
- Document manifest acquisition from each vendor
- Provide working configuration examples
- Include troubleshooting for vendor-specific issues

## Success Metrics for v1.0 Launch
- [ ] All 4 vendors can be successfully installed and configured
- [ ] End-to-end workflow works reliably for each vendor
- [ ] Documentation enables successful first-time setup
- [ ] Performance meets stated benchmarks (100K+ certs/hour)
- [ ] Security standards maintained across all integrations

## Post-v1.0.0 Immediate Roadmap

### v1.0.1 - Multi-Attachment Enhancement (Next Step)
**Multiple Policy, Thing Type, and Thing Group Support**
- Enable attachment to multiple Thing Groups (e.g., department + location + product)
- Support multiple policies for layered access control
- Allow multiple Thing Types for complex device categorization
- Maintain backward compatibility with single attachments
- **Use Case:** Enterprise IoT deployments with complex organizational hierarchies
- **Priority:** High - addresses fundamental configuration limitation for enterprise users
