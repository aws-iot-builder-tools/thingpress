# Thingpress Installation Guide

This guide covers the complete installation and setup process for Thingpress, including vendor-specific configurations.

## Prerequisites

- [Identify any need to increase limit quotas](aws-api-limits.md)
- Amazon Web Services account. If you don't have an account, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/setting-up.html. The relevant sections are **Sign up for an AWS account** and **Create a user and grant permissions**
- Basic experience with Amazon CloudFormation 
- Linux workstation or Amazon Linux EC2 instance with:
  - Docker
  - Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface (CLI)
  - Amazon Web Services Serverless Application Model (SAM) CLI
  - Amazon Web Services IAM credentials with appropriate Role permissions and programmatic access for: IAM, SQS, S3, Lambda, IoT, CloudFormation, CloudWatch

## Step 1: Prepare AWS IoT Objects

Before starting, you must identify the AWS IoT objects you will use. 

These objects must be created in IoT Core prior to running an import job. The import job will halt on the product validation stage if you define an object but it does not exist in IoT Core.

See the project root README.md for links to each type of object.

- **Optional but virtually mandatory:** AWS IoT Policy 
- **Optional but highly recommended:** AWS IoT Thing Type
- **Optional but highly recommended:** AWS IoT Thing Group

## Step 2: Prepare to Build and Deploy Thingpress

These steps assume you are building and installing the tool on a GNU/Linux operating system such as a local workstation or EC2 instance with the appropriate policy and/or IAM credential.

1. **Clone the thingpress repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/awslabs/thingpress thingpress
   cd thingpress
   ```
2. **Install Python 3.13**. You will want to use pyenv on top of your system python. See https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv for installation instructions. Then invoke `pyenv install 3.13` and then `pyenv local 3.13`.

3. **Install python module dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Step 3: Build and Deploy Thingpress

These steps assume you are building and installing the tool on a GNU/Linux operating system such as a local workstation or EC2 instance with the appropriate policy and/or IAM credential.

Choose your hardware vendor and follow the vendor-specific deployment instructions:

### Select Your Vendor:

- **[Espressif Systems (ESP32-S3)](../vendors/espressif.md#deployment)** - For ESP32-S3 devices with pre-provisioned certificates
- **[Infineon Technologies (Optiga Trust M Express)](../vendors/infineon.md#deployment)** - For Optiga Trust M Express security chips
- **[Microchip Technology (Trust&Go ATECC608B)](../vendors/microchip.md#deployment)** - For Trust&Go ATECC608B with TLS
- **[Generated Certificates](../vendors/generated.md#deployment)** - For programmatically generated certificates or migration scenarios

Each vendor guide will walk you through:
- Vendor-specific SAM deployment parameters
- How to obtain certificate manifests from the vendor
- Deployment command examples
- Manifest upload process

## Step 4: Verify Installation

After completing your vendor-specific deployment, return here to verify your installation:

1. **Check CloudFormation stack status**
   ```bash
   aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name <your-stack-name>
   ```

2. **Verify S3 buckets were created**
   ```bash
   aws s3 ls | grep <your-stack-name>
   ```

3. **Test with a small manifest file** (follow your vendor's upload process)

   Small manifests are available in test/artifacts. You can use these to verify that the objects you configured get attached / used as expected.

4. **Monitor processing in CloudWatch Logs**
   - Navigate to CloudWatch â†’ Log groups
   - Look for log groups with your stack name prefix
   - Monitor certificate processing progress

## Step 5: Production Readiness

Before processing large certificate batches:

1. **Review [AWS API limits](aws-api-limits.md)** and request increases if needed
2. **Test with small batches** (100-1000 certificates) first
3. **Monitor performance** and adjust throttling if necessary
4. **Verify AWS IoT objects** are created correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
- Check CloudWatch Logs for error messages
- Verify AWS IAM permissions are correctly configured
- Ensure AWS IoT objects (Policy, Thing Type, Thing Group) exist
- Refer to vendor-specific troubleshooting in the vendor documentation

## Next Steps

- **Upload certificates:** Follow your vendor's manifest upload process
- **Monitor processing:** Use CloudWatch to track certificate import progress
- **Scale up:** Process larger certificate batches once testing is complete
